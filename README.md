# Weather-Planner-per-City

I was motivated to start this project by my growing passion to learn about Web API's. I feel like out of all my web developing knowledge that I;ve
gained so far, this is the most crucial knowledge. API's are the first thing we've learned about databases and requests, so I'm intrigued.

I built this project to test my own knowledge of what I've learned about web developing so far. In class and also outside of class.

My weather forecasting project allows users to find the weather forecast for the next 5 days, based on a search forn their city. This 
allows users to be prepared and ready for whatever weather is expected to come their way, solving the problem of uncertainty about the week's weather 
forecast.

I learned that fetch requests are the most useful thing that I've learned in class so far. Fetch requests are very crucial in a webpage that needs to implement
certain data, without having to write it all out, or even know the data.
